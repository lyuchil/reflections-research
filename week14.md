The paper I decided to look at this week is Rainbow Colormaps Are Not All Bad. In the article it states that they prior research has shwon that Rainbow Color Map is still considered harmful. This is something that I have never paid attention to or seen as much. So I am rather curious about the positive and negatives of a Rainbow Colo Map. The main issue with rainbow color is that they are not monotonic in luimnance, which can interrupt other people's perception of the shape. The next problem is that the map will not be uniform and it can distort the perception of data variation. Lastly, the color will divie the map in potential regions, which can be misleading. The authors claim that these are valid arguments against the traditional raindow. One of hte problem with raindow is that we cannot make out the shape from the coloring. Though in a map designed to read temperature, it is not necessary. If the goal is to preceive shape from shading, then there are other methods of visualizing. The biggest problem is how it creates visual segmentation. These effects are useful when trying to compare specific values, but real segmentation requires the creator to intentionally aligning with the data semnatics. It seems that people criticize rainbow colormap is because of its earlier designs. However, with newer designs and research showing that a well-designed multihue map can increase accuracy and performance in visualization, it doesn't seem so bad. I do really that the only times where I see rainbow color maps are in the weather channel on temperature. I never truly studied or tried to implement a rainbow color map so this was an interesting discussion to look at. The nexct closet thing to me is probably heatmat where the changing in intensity of color makes it easy to understand. Though there seems to be more need to research on how to use rainbow colormaps to make them effective, I think it would be interesting to compare making a map using colormap and without it. The article brought this topic into focus and I am curious to see what would be the performance results.
