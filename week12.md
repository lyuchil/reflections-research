This paper explored how leaving the context of visualizations out can negatively impact the understanding and transparency. They ran two experiemnts, one that explored how different types of chart, topic, and user goal impacted the categories of metadata that was important. The second experiemnt was about how the types of metadata influence transparency, trustworthiness, and persuasivness, information relevance, and understanding. Stuidies have suggested that metadata can help with understanding and transparency as they can have impact on precption. Metadata can also affect how accurately someone understand a visualization. One finding from the research is that metadata had no impact on informtaion relevance. This is not very surprising as the information presented may not be connected to a person's life at all. I have considered the involvement of context/some information with my visulization, but I have not considered the incoorporation of metadata. Given the results and discussion, it is still uncelar to me whether the inclusion of metadata is necessary. This decision seems to lie in whether or not the data itself has certain degree of uncertainty or bias. In that situation, metadata should be provided as context. In most scneario though, it does not seem necessary to provide metadata with the visualization.
