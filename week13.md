Paper Title: What Do We Actually Learn from Evaluations in the “Heroic Era” of Visualization?


The author of the paper calls in question that if the current evaluations of the visualization research is effective and useful. They claim that compared to the heroic age of the medicines. They did not lack theroy, but they practied it and try to proof those theories correct. Acoording to the author, the modern visualization age focuses on how to do something rather than knowing something as a fact. Research tend to continously research new methods and ways to visualize, but does not explain what the visualization tell us. One of my immediate thought for this paepr is that while it has an interesting question, the way it is presented seems to be lacking. From my perspective, I would be interesting in learning more about this topic and why it might be an issue, but I read a lot of what if scenarios or examples. It feels to me that the paper is starting the argument rather than trying to actively proof it. While I think this makes a good start, it felt lacking. In some other paper that I have read, even if they are just propsing a theory, they would have some sort of design on how they would proof it. There are still valid points in the paper that argues to admit when a design does not work as well as intended. It is a balance that needs to be achieved when doing research.
