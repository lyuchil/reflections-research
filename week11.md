The paper I am looking at this week is related to data comics and how it should be used in user studies. The author believes that using data comics by tighly integrating text and images, illustrating design descisions, and key visuals can be compelling to the general public. The goal is to design a framework that is not to replace exsisting methods or force all researchers to adapt, but to provide guidance and encourage more efficient explanation and visualizations. This is the first time that I have hear of data comics, so I was interested in reading the paper. Comics are a unqiue medium of communication since they are not limited to specific styles or format. It enables a space for creative ways to report data and result compared to regular tables or other chart types. Data comics adds a layer on top of just showing regular results, it demonstrates the entire process that it took to get to the result. The paper also goes through specific stages about creawting a data comic. To create a data comic, we have to show the purpose of motive of the research, what is the goal, experiment setup, and additional result with evaluation. When presenting the data comics to users for review, it was well received. The paper encourages co-design for researchers in differnet fields to design and make more easily understood visualizations.

Data comics is a another method to convey the results to different audiences. There are topics that should be public-aware, but due to the difficulty in presentation or understanding, it is hard for the general public to take interest in. I think the reason why I wanted to try scrollytelling is because of that. Though this does give me another option for visualization in the future. This is a medium that I have not seen much, but can provide a complete view of the research in simple manner. This is something I would also like to try to create/build in the future.
